Rafay serves as a centralized place to manage your workloads across many clusters. By workloads here, we mean user-facing applications.

The controller allows users to create and manage multiple types of workloads.

Three types of workloads are supported:

1. Kubernetes YAML
2. Helm Charts
3. Workload Wizard
