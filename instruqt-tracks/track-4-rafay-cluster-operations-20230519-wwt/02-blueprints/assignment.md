Organizations with a fleet of Kubernetes clusters need capabilities to ensure that their clusters are compliant and have a certain baseline set of software components as required by the organization.

For example, consider a global organization in the financial vertical with 10-20 Kubernetes clusters. They may require some of their clusters to be compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standard and some of their clusters may be under the purview of GDPR. In addition, they may also have some clusters used by their QA teams that may require certain specialized software addons critical for their function.

It is extremely challenging, operationally cumbersome, error prone and time-consuming to do this manually. **Cluster blueprinting capabilities are focused on addressing this challenge.**
