Kubernetes natively provides the means to logically separate a cluster into multiple virtual clusters called "namespaces".

Namespaces are intended for situations where multiple users need to share the same Kubernetes cluster.

Namespaces can be configured to ensure that each user or application exists within its namespace and is isolated from every other user of the cluster.
