Golden "Cluster Blueprints" capability is an extension of Default (System) Blueprints and can be used to create/enforce a baseline set of add-ons/policies. Users can use it as a base blueprint for any new custom blueprint/versions or deploy Golden Blueprints to clusters.

Golden Blueprints offers the following benefits:

**Usability:**<br>
* Easy to maintain & manage lifecycle of Custom Blueprints.

**Governance:**<br>
* Ensure that certain baseline applications are always installed and clusters are in compliance
