You must run this script even if you already have an account in the Organization.

If you do not already have an account in the Organization, after clicking **Next**, check your email to complete the account onboarding process. Look for an email from notify-signups@rafay.co and follow the steps in that email.

Once you have accurately entered your info in the script, click **Next** to proceed to the labs.
